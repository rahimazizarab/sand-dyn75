quoting verbatim from the above
A decNumber user has reported that Visual Studio 2010 (32 bit) has difficulty with compiling the decNumber source files.
Here are his workarounds.
http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decnumVS.html

the workaround has been implemented using
quoting verbatim from the above

Method 2:
In file: "decBasic.c"
1. Change extension from .c to .h

2. Add the following at the beginning of the code:
#if !defined(DECBASIC)
#define DECBASIC

3. Add the following at the end of the code:
#endif

4. Replace the following line 2 lines
#error decBasic.c must be included after decCommon.c
#error Routines in decBasic.c are for decDouble and decQuad only
with
#error decBasic.h must be included after decCommon.h
#error Routines in decBasic.h are for decDouble and decQuad only
respectively.

In file "decCommon.c"
1. Change extension from .c to .h

2. Add the following at the beginning of the code:
#if !defined(DECCOMMON)
#define DECCOMMON
3. Add the following at the end of the code:
#endif

In the following files:
decQuad.c
decDouble.c
decSingle.c

replace lines:
#include "decCommon.c"
#include "decBasic.c"

with
#include "decCommon.h"
#include "decBasic.h"

as applicable.

References to decCommon.c and decBasic.c in commentary should also be modified to refer to the corresponding .h.


NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE

decnumber.h has been modified to add ...

#if defined( _MSVC_ )
    /* disable some MSVC compiler warnings                            */
    /* for 64bits builds under WINDOWS 7                              */
    #pragma warning( disable: 4244 ) // "conversion from 'x' to 'y', possible loss of data"
#endif

to get rid of a "show stopper" for 64bits MSVC builds
